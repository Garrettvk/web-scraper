So how are you going to approach to know accurately that we got them all?
    df = product_category_urls.csv
    number_of_products = df['# of Products'].sum()

    when the scrapers are done the will produce a csv of the results. 
    If the number of products found isn't 100% the scrapers will rescrape all the product categories.
    if a product category is different than what is all ready is the results csv file

    Should we be scraping the stock number?
        the stock number needs to be updated

Update function
    should check if product_category_urls.csv has changed

    if the number of products for a url has changed
        iterate over the product pages
            if a product already exsists
                skip over it
            else
                add data
