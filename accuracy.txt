Update function
    should check if product_category_urls.csv has changed

    if the number of products for a url has changed
        iterate over the product pages
            if a product already exsists
                skip over it
            else
                add data
    
    keep track of product urls with driver.current_url
        using url pattern from style code and product name works but isnt the same as driver.current_url
        run the web scraper again and keep track of urls

        scrape each product
        if product name

    remove duplicates with df = df.loc[:,~df.columns.duplicated()]
