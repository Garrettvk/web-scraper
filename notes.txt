get links function should get links from every page not just the first.


this program could be improved by:
    clean description
    add domain to image links
    organize functions

Notes on all products scraped
    I'm not sure if every product was scraped

    start time = 2020, 8, 5, 1, 13, 1, 380536
    end time = (2020, 8, 5, 23, 20, 22, 280779)

    there are 24541 products
        make a program that can find the current # of products

    the process took 22 hours	6 minutes	39 seconds
        about 1115 products an hour

    look at the output with index, hidden characters are throwing off the line numbers
    overall data needs to be cleaned

SAVE URLS YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TO
    if url is already record
        if it still exsits:
            skip
        else:
            remove data
    if url hasn't been recorded
        if it exsists
            get data
            record link
