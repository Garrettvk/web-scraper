get links function should get links from every page not just the first.


this program could be improved by:
    clean description
    add domain to image links
    organize functions

we need to scrape all jewelry
    I need to iterate over each category and sub category
        all the categories are in the drop down menu of jewelry button
    i need to get ever url for every piece of jewelry
        check for and remove duplicate links
        once the urls are found save them to a file
        check new arrivals and if non of the urls have been saved, add it to the file of urls
        How would you keep track of deleted items?
        
    then scrape the data

    you could make the scraper faster by disabling images
        avoid the next button by finding the number of pages based on raw html
        url patterns match the number of pages

    one scraper is picking up hair comb
        skip porducts that aren't jewelry
