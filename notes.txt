get links function should get links from every page not just the first.


this program could be improved by:
    clean description
    add domain to image links
    organize functions

# login
    # turn this off in production, use method up top ^
    username = 'tmebatson@gmail.com'
    password = 'hRIcV'

    domain = r'https://www.wonatrading.com/'

    # load hompage first so that it picks up cookies
    driver.get(domain)
    driver.get(r'https://www.wonatrading.com/login')  # wona login page

    username_textbox = driver.find_element_by_name(
        'email_address')  # find element for email input
    username_textbox.send_keys(username)  # send what you put as userinput

    password_textbox = driver.find_element_by_name(
        'password')  # find element for password input
    password_textbox.send_keys(password)  # send what you put as password

    login_button = driver.find_element_by_id(
        'btnLogin')  # element of login button
    login_button.click()  # clicks login button
