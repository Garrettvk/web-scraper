Webscraper

    i've scraped the first product from each product page but im only getting one product back
    Im assuming this is because the function only returns one product at a time.
    to solve this:
        create a list to hold each product df
        run the for loop
            variable = return of function
            append variable to list
        
        concat everything in the list to one df
        print df
        write to csv

variant template
    four digit product code should be sequential: 0001, 0002, 0003
    categories isn't formatted right, check slack for more details

use get pass for login password
create a django site with authentication that london can use to run the scraper
thinking about how this can be easy as possible considering she wants it to be automated
a really simple jupyter notebook might be easier
