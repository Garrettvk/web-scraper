look over categories
    if page numbers don't match:
        iterate products in that category
        save urls of each product to a list called visited_products

once we save all the product urls, we can use them to check whats missing
when scraper runs again it will check if url is visited

if the url has been visited but is no longer online
    remove product

if url is online and has not been visited
    add product
